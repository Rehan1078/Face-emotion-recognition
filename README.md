#Face-Emotion-Recognition
Welcome to the Face-Emotion-Recognition project! This repository contains a TensorFlow-based implementation for detecting and classifying human emotions from facial expressions. Built with TensorFlow 2.10.0 and Python 3.10.7, the project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to analyze facial images and predict emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset to ensure high accuracy and robustness across different face types and expressions. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this project provides a solid foundation for further exploration and application in areas like human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and psychological studies. Dive in to explore the code, experiment with the model, and contribute to improving emotion recognition technology!
